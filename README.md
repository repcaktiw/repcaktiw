# Hi, I am repcaktiw 👋 

I'm just starting my coding journey. I'm from Poland and I live in Poznań. I'm treating coding as a hobby right now, and I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I'm mostly interested in web development so I’m trying to get everything connected with this topic right now. Currently I'm mainly focusing on vanilla JavaScript. That will give me good foundation for both frontend and backend development. While I'm polishing my skills right now, I'm also thinking about personal development. In near future I'd like to jump into frontend frameworks (React I suppose) but I'm also thinking about trying get into backend with node.js and express.

### 🔭 I am Currently Focusing on

- Practicins JavaScript (my main focus)
- Working with CSS Frameworks
- Practicing HTML and CSS skills
- Learning how to become better programmer

### 🌱 Future goals

- Learning advanced CSS and SASS
- Learning one of the frontend frameworks
- Learning Node.js and Express basics
- Creating interesting and fun projects to polish my skills
- Be productiove, don't get stuck, have motivation and fun with coding
